# Rock_Paper_Sicssors

This was my third TOP project.

I really enjoyed working on this project and it made me more comfortable with JS and CSS.

What I've learned:
1.more css features such as : A.importing different fonts and using them correctly.
                              B.using https://coolors.co to get good color schemes.
                              C.improving my FlexBox abilities.

2.JS and its basics

3.dealing with git branches thanks to TOP instructions.

Alhamdulillah.
