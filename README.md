# Rock_Paper_Sicssors

This was my third TOP project.

I really enjoyed working on this project and it made me more comfortable with JS and CSS.

Alhamdulillah.

# What I've learned:

1. More css features such as:
- Importing different fonts and using them correctly.
- using https://coolors.co to get good color schemes.
- improving my FlexBox abilities.

2. JS and its basics

3. Dealing with git branches thanks to TOP instructions.
